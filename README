This directory contains all learn python the hard wayprojects I have ever worked on starting from Saturday August 15th 12:49:17 BST 2015.

The project numbering will start from 0001. 

The standard naming procedure will be 'P' for Project followed by the project number, an underscore, and finally a descriptive name for the project all lowercase with no spaces. 

For example: P0001_helloworld
